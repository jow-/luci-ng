# LuciNg2

Luci-NG implementation using Angular 4 + Material 2.

## Install
You need `Node` and `Npm` installed in the development machine.

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

All `Ubus` calls are forwarded to the LEDE box using the settings in `proxy.conf.json`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

Building of the ipk package is not yet implemented.
